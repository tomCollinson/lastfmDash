lastfmDash
==========

A responsive AngularJS based app that shows recent tracks played from your Last.fm account using the CD cover or image provided by Last.fm. If a corresponding track can be found on Spotify the option to play the track will be shown when hovering over the track.

Images now make use of the lazy loading technique to bring down data transfer on mobile devices

###Coming Soon

* The ability for a user to change the last.fm username used to display recent tracks. At present the application only uses one username provided in configuration files.
* Top artist charts for the given username
* Artist pages to include upcoming events
* more TBC
